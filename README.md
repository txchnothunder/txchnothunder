### I am a current Master of Data Science student at UC Irvine and an aspiring data scientist.

My Github is still under construction as I'm migrating a lot of projects onto Github, but I hope you enjoy the ones available!
Although I still have a lot to learn, I hope to develop user-friendly software so data analysis is simple, easy, and efficient
for everyone to use.
Feel free to give any advice or feedback, as I wish to learn as much and as many things as possible to improve myself!

**Want to reach me?** Send me an [email](mailto:ethanlw1@uci.edu) and I'll respond as soon as possible!
